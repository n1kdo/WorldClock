# WorldClock

`WorldClock` is a Windows API program I wrote in 1995.

![Example](clocks.png)

This small program displays digital clocks on your monitor.  
You can have 1..n clocks displaying different time zones.
I wrote it in 1995, but I still use it today to show GMT and Local time.

I'm putting it on GitHub because others might find it useful.
